- 👋 Hi, I’m @goalkan
- 👀 I’m interested in all the engineering stuff. Since 2012 I've been working as design engineer from vehicle to powertrain application on vehicles. Corona pandemic changed everything so I've decided to gain more abilities like software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and I am quite new actually since then after my first C language course in BSc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can contribute
- 📫 I am always reachable by email or message.
